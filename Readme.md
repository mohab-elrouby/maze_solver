# Maze Solver

This project implements a maze-solving algorithm using the Depth-First Search (DFS) method and visualizes the process using Pygame. The maze can be loaded from a file, and the solution path is displayed in a graphical window.

## Overview

- **Algorithm:** Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path from the start position to the end position in the maze.
- **Visualization:** Displays the maze and the search process in a Pygame window, showing different cell states with different colors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

To install Pygame, run:

```bash
pip install pygame
